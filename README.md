# GifTastic

In this game, you'll use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice.

1. When the user clicks on a button, the page will show 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.
2. When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.
3. The user also can type singer they like, when the user clicks "submit" button, it will show the singer button the user typeed.
4. When the user clicks the button they create, the page will show 10 gif images as well.
